Given an array arr[] that may contain duplicates. Find all possible distinct permutations of the array in sorted order.
Note: A sequence A is greater than sequence B if there is an index i for which Aj = Bj for all j<i and Ai > Bi.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3]
Output: [[1, 3, 3], [3, 1, 3], [3, 3, 1]]
Explanation: These are the only possible distinct permutations for the given array.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3]
Output: [[2, 3], [3, 2]]
Explanation: These are the only possible distinct permutations for the given array.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 9
