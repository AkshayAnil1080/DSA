Porblem:- Given an integer array arr[] of size n which contains only 1 and 0. Your task is to make the array perfect. 
An array is said to be perfect if for each i from 0 to n-1 arr[i]==arr[n-1-i] is satisfied. 
To Make the array perfect you are allowed to do the following operation  :
    In one operation you can choose two different indexes i and j and set value of both arr[i] and arr[j] to arr[i]^arr[j].
    
    Your task is to make the array perfect in minimum possible number of operations and return the number of operations.
